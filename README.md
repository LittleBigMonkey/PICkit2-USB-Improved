# PICkit2-USB-Improved
Improve the USB recognition of PICkit2 software.

There is a limitation of 20 USB ports recognized in the original software, which cause the programation board to not be recognized on some USB ports.
The limit has been updated to 50 and now the board is working even on a Microsoft Surface Pro.

Replace the exe in your installation folder.
